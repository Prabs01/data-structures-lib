# ðŸ“š Data Structures Library in C++  
> **Having trouble implementing all the data structures by hand?**  
> No worries â€” this project aims to abstract the implementation details of various fundamental and advanced data structures in clean, well-documented C++ code.  

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals  
This library is designed to:  
- Provide **modular, reusable, and educational implementations** of data structures in C++.  
- Serve as a **learning resource** for students and developers preparing for coding interviews or building CS fundamentals.  
- Offer a **lightweight C++ alternative** to STL for deeper understanding of internal mechanics.

## ðŸ§± Included Data Structures  

### Linear Structures  
- Linked List  
- Queue  
- Stack  

### Trees  
- Binary Tree  

### Hashing  
- Hash Table using folding with separate chaining  

### Graphs

## ðŸŽ¨ Sorting Algorithm Visualizer  
Alongside data structures, this project also includes a **real-time sorting algorithm visualizer** built using **SFML**.  
You can watch algorithms like:  
- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Heap Sort  
- Radix Sort  
- Shell Sort  

Run it with:  
```bash
./sorting_visualize

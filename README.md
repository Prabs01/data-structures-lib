# ðŸ“š Data Structures Library in C++

> **Having trouble implementing all the data structures by hand?**  
> No worries â€” this project aims to abstract the implementation details of various fundamental and advanced data structures in clean, well-documented C++ code.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

This library is designed to:

- Provide **modular, reusable, and educational implementations** of data structures in C++.
- Serve as a **learning resource** for students and developers preparing for coding interviews or building CS fundamentals.
- Offer a **lightweight C++ alternative** to STL for deeper understanding of internal mechanics.

## ðŸ§± Included Data Structures

### Linear Structures
- Linked List
- Queue

### Trees
- Binary Tree


### Hashing


### Graphs

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Each data structure includes:
- Clean, minimal test cases under `tests/`
- Easy-to-run CMake build system
- Option to integrate GoogleTest for advanced testing
